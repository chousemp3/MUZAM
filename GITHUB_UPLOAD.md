# 🚀 MUZAM GitHub Upload Guide

## 🔥 Your MUZAM project is ready to go LIVE on GitHub!

### Step 1: Create GitHub Repository
1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Repository name: `MUZAM`
3. Description: `🎵 MUZAM - Open Source Audio Recognition • Better than Shazam • GhostKitty UI`
4. Make it **Public** (so everyone can see this fire!)
5. Don't initialize with README (we already have one!)
6. Click **Create repository**

### Step 2: Upload the Screenshot
1. After creating the repo, go to **Issues** tab
2. Click **New Issue**  
3. Drag and drop your FIRE screenshot into the issue description
4. Copy the image URL (it will look like: `https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/xyz...`)
5. Close the issue (we just needed the image URL)

### Step 3: Update README with Screenshot
Edit the README.md file and replace this line:
```
![MUZAM GhostKitty Interface](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/your-screenshot-url-here)
```
With your actual screenshot URL.

### Step 4: Push to GitHub
Run these commands in your terminal:

```bash
cd /home/m3/Desktop/MUZAM

# Add GitHub remote (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/MUZAM.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 5: Set up GitHub Pages (Optional)
1. Go to your repo **Settings** > **Pages**
2. Source: **Deploy from a branch**
3. Branch: **main** / folder: **/ (root)**
4. Your web app will be live at `https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/MUZAM`

### Step 6: Add Topics
In your GitHub repo:
1. Click the ⚙️ gear icon next to "About"
2. Add topics: `audio-recognition`, `music`, `shazam`, `privacy`, `open-source`, `python`, `fastapi`, `machine-learning`, `ghostkitty`

### Step 7: Create First Release
Once everything is uploaded, run:
```bash
./scripts/release.sh
```
This will create your v1.0.0 release!
